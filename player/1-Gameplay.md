Realms of the Fifth System is a 5e-compatabile expansion on the core SRD 5.2.1 rules. In this document, we will summarize the rules of play and provide options Players can ask their Game Master about.


# Basic Gameplay Loop
1) The GM narrates a scene to the players, with or without a prompt or call to action.
2) The Players respond by describing or roleplaying their Character's actions, according to their own preferences.
3) The GM narrates the results of the Player's actions, repeating Step 2 until the Players accomplish their goal, fail irreversibly, or give up.

Once the players accomplish a goal, the GM narrates the results of their success, such as access to new areas, gold, items, or character advancement. The GM then moves on to the next scene, returning to Step 1 until the conclusion of the adventure, or the end of the gameplay session. Players mark these rewards on their character sheet, and gameplay continues until the end of the session or current adventure, whichever comes first.

# Abilities
There are Six Abilities in Fifth Edition. These abilities measure the mental and physical capabilities of a particular character or creature.
- Strength (Str)
- Dexterity (Dex)
- Constitution (Con)
- Intelligence (int)
- Wisdom (Wis)
- Charisma (Cha)
All Creatures and some Objects, such as Vehicles and Seige Equipment, have these 6 scores. Some GM's may decide to include other Ability scores at their table, depending on the campaign and story setting, but in the vast majority of 5e games, these are the only Six Abilities.

## Ability Scores
For most creatures, an individual Ability Score ranges between 1-20. Some creatures, however, may have ability scores up to 30.
- 0 : Objects typically have Int, Wis, and Cha of 0, automatically failing those saving throws. Otherwise, all Ability Scores have a minimum of 1.
- 1 : The lowest an ability score can go, unless an effects states otherwise.
- 2-9 : Below Average
- 10 - 11 : Average Human Capability
- 12 - 19 : Above Average
- 20 : Peak Human Capability, unless an effect or feature says otherwise.
- 21 - 29 : Superhuman Capability, not attainable without a special effect or feature.
- 30 : The highest a score can go in standard, Level 1 - 20 5th edition play.
- 31+ : World-breaking Capability, at your GM's discretion. Not balanced for traditional play.

## Ability Modifiers
The formula for Ability Modifiers is (Ability Score - 10)/2, rounded down. In Traditional Play, the table below is sufficient for determining Ability Modifiers. It's worth noting now that in 5th edition, we **always round down**, except in one very special case discussed in "Character Creation".
```
Score | Modifier
  0 | Auto fail
  1 | -5
2-3 | -4
4-5 | -3
6-7 | -2
8-9 | -1
10-11 | +0
12-13 | +1
14-15 | +2
16-17 | +3
18-19 | +4
20-21 | +5
22-23 | +6
24-25 | +7
26-27 | +8
28-29 | +9
   30 | +10
```

## Ability Checks
An ability check represents a creature attempting an action in service of accomplishing a goal.
- Strength : Lift push, pull, drag, etc
- Dexterity : Move quietly, quickly, or nimbly
- Constitution : Endurance and General Toughness
- Intelligence : Reasoning and Recollection
- Wisdom : Notice details and make connections, communicate without language
- Charisma : Amuse, deceive, or otherwise influence another creature with language

## Proficiency Bonus
Whenever you make an Ability Check, you may apply your Proficiency Bonus if you are Proficient in a relevant skill, tool, vehicle, or language.
